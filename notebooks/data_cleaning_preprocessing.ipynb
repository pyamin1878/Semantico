The film focuses around Indonesia\\'s religious pluralism, which often results in conflict between different beliefs, represented in a plot that revolves around the interactions of three families, one Buddhist, one Muslim, and one Catholic. After undergoing numerous hardships and the deaths of several family members in religious violence, they are reconciled.\\nBased on Bramantyo\\'s experiences as a mixed-race child, ? was meant to counter the portrayal of Islam as a \"radical religion\". Owing to the film\\'s theme of religious pluralism and controversial subject matter, Bramantyo had difficulty finding backing. Eventually, Mahaka Pictures put forth Rp 5 billion ($600,000) to fund the production. Filming began on 5 January 2011 in Semarang.\\nReleased on 7 April 2011, ? was a critical and commercial success: it received favourable reviews and was viewed by more than 550,000 people. Screened internationally, it was nominated for nine Citra Awards at the 2011 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one.

To ensure good relations with his Muslim employees and customers, Sun uses special utensils for the preparation of pork, which he does not permit to be used for other dishes, and allows his staff time for prayers; he also gives them a holiday during Eid ul-Fitr, the largest Muslim holiday. One of his employees is Menuk, who supports her unemployed husband, Soleh. Rika is Menuk's friend and is involved with the unsuccessful Muslim actor Surya.\\nAlready in his 70s, Sun falls ill and the restaurant is taken over by Hendra, who decides it will serve exclusively pork, alienating their Muslim customers. Hendra comes into conflict with Soleh over Menuk, as Hendra had previously dated her. Menuk becomes increasingly depressed after Soleh tells her that he plans to divorce her, and they are driven apart. Rika feels stressed as a result of how she has been treated by her neighbours and family after converting to Catholicism from Islam; Abi is also facing ostracism. Meanwhile, Surya and Doni are competing for Rika's affections. Surya is upset over his failure to find a good acting job.\\nSoleh joins the Islamic charitable group Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), hoping to gain confidence. Though he is initially reluctant to protect the security of a church during Christmas Eve, he ends up sacrificing his life when he discovers a bomb has been planted inside the church. He rushes out with the bomb, which explodes outside, killing him but saving the worshippers. Later, Sun dies when the restaurant, which did not close to honour Eid ul-Fitr, is attacked by a mob of fundamentalist Muslims. After the attack, Hendra reads the 99 names of Allah and converts to Islam; he attempts to approach Menuk, although it is unclear if she will accept him. Surya receives an offer from Rika to play the role of Jesus in her church's Christmas and Easter pageants, which he accepts for a high fee after hesitating due to fears that it will be against his religion; after the pageant he reads Al-Ikhlas in a mosque.

       "  '? was directed by Hanung Bramantyo, who is of mixed Chinese-Javanese descent. He decided to direct a pluralist-themed film based on his own experiences as a mixed-race child. He chose the title ? to avoid protests upon the film\\'s release, saying that if it had been named Liberalism or Pluralism there would be protests by opponents of those ideologies, and that he could not think of a better title. The individual characters are based on people Bramantyo has known or read about. His goal in making the film was to \"clarify misleading arguments about Islam\" and counter the portrayal of Islam as a \"radical religion\". In a pre-release press conference, Bramantyo said that ? was not meant to be commercial, but to make a statement. The film, his fourteenth, is one of several Islam-themed movies he has directed, after the polygamous romantic drama Ayat-Ayat Cinta (The Verses of Love; 2008) and the biopic Sang Pencerah (The Enlightener; 2009).\\nFearing that the theme of pluralism would be taken as a \"battle cry\", some investors abandoned their commitments; Bramantyo was also unable to find support from mainstream studios. Before screening the film for the Indonesian Film Censor Board, several scenes were cut, including one in which a pig\\'s head was displayed in the window of Sun\\'s restaurant; other scenes that raised commentary were kept, although trimmed. Prior to the film\\'s release, Bramantyo consulted about twenty people, including several religious leaders, in an attempt to ensure that the film was not offensive. Titien Wattimena was brought in to work further with the script; she put more emphasis on the message of tolerance.Mahaka Pictures, owned by the same group as the predominantly Muslim Republika, co-produced the film with Dapur Film. The director of Mahaka Pictures, Erick Thohir, stated that his company had assisted with production because he \"was disturbed by the fact that Indonesian films have declined in quality\". He was willing to work with Bramantyo, as he found that the latter had proven to be a skilled director of religious films through his earlier work. Filming began on 5 January 2011 in Semarang; Bramantyo later described the city as a good example of tolerance in action. The film reportedly cost Rp 5 billion ($600,000) to produce. Two songs by the Indonesian band Sheila on 7, \"Pasti Kubisa\" (\"Sure I Can\") and \"Kamus Hidupku\" (\"Dictionary to My Life\") were used in the soundtrack, while Satrio Budiono and Saft Daultsyah handled sound editing.Mulyo Hadi Purnomo, based in Semarang, was tasked with casting the minor roles. Bramantyo contacted the main cast members directly. Agus Kuncoro, who had acted in Sang Pencerah and was known for playing in Islamic-themed films, agreed to play Surya in ? immediately after reading the script. Singer Glenn Fredly was interested in playing Doni because he considered the character, an ultra-conservative Catholic, an interesting role, given the sensitive religious situation in the country. Revalina S. Temat, who had appeared in Bramantyo\\'s 2009 film Perempuan Berkalung Sorban (The Girl With the Keffiyeh Around Her Neck), found her role as Menuk interesting and more serious than her recent work in horror films. Endhita, whom Bramantyo called for the role, expressed interest as soon as she received an outline of the plot.'],\n",

       "  'Ade Irwansyah, writing for Tabloid Bintang, notes that the film is a \"microcosm\" of Indonesia, which has numerous religious groups that often come into conflict. Irwansyah writes that Bramantyo intended for viewers to think of the religious conflicts that happen daily, and how to deal with differences in culture and beliefs, while Bramantyo has called the film his own personal interpretation of the country\\'s religious situation. The film critic Eric Sasono noted this was apparent from the film\\'s tagline, \"Is it still important that we are different?\", and suggested that Bramantyo feared that Indonesia was becoming a monolithic state. According to Sasono, the conflict in ? is settled when the characters begin believing that all religions are good, and all praise God; thus, all religious conflict would end if people were to accept other beliefs.The Jakarta Globe describes the film as a \"study of the role and state of Islam in modern Indonesian society\". Sasono noted that the Muslim majority in the film did not have their motives shown explicitly, be it for the use of the racist term \"Cino\" or for attacking Sun\\'s restaurant. After comparing the actions of Muslim groups in ? and Asrul Sani\\'s films Al Kautsar (1977) and Titian Serambut Dibelah Tujuh (Titian Serambut, Divided by Seven; 1982), Sasono suggested that Bramantyo may have been expressing a fear that these groups no longer needed provocateurs to attack others. He notes that a scene in which a Catholic priest is stabbed by two men on a motorcycle reflects a September 2010 case in Bekasi, which had become a national issue. He further describes the camera angles as vulgar, abandoning subtlety, but suggests that they made the work more dramatic; he indicates that this was readily apparent with a scene in which part of a mosque falls apart.']]"

The bank had outgrown its offices at 55 Wall Street by February 1927, prompting bank officials to announce plans for a 31-story building on the site of its old headquarters at 52 Wall Street. National City Bank\\'s compound interest and trust departments moved to the new building at 52 Wall Street in May 1928.National City Bank and the Farmers\\' Loan and Trust Company merged in 1929, with the latter becoming the City Bank Farmers Trust Company. Two years later, City Bank Farmers Trust erected 20 Exchange Place immediately to the south to house the operations of the expanded bank. First National Bank temporarily moved to 55 Wall Street from its former location at 2 Wall Street, when that structure was weakened during the construction of an annex to 14 Wall Street, although First National returned to 2 Wall Street in 1933. 55 Wall Street and 20 Exchange Place collectively served as National City Bank\\'s global headquarters and were connected by a now-demolished pedestrian bridge over Exchange Place. Initially, 55 Wall Street did not have any signage indicating that it housed the National City Bank. In 1947, bank officials decided to install a sign with the bank\\'s name outside the building because visitors frequently got lost while looking for the bank.']b"

The DVD featured Indonesian audio, Indonesian and English subtitles, a behind-the-scenes documentary, and a gallery of photographs from production. In a preface on the DVD\\'s liner notes, Ronny P. Tjandra of Jive! Collection wrote that viewers should view the film with open hearts, as the conflicts within reflected actualities in society.\\n\\nCritical reaction to ? was favourable. Indah Setiawati of The Jakarta Post wrote that the film was a \"gallant attempt to promoted  [sic] moderate Islam and reveal the sensitive issues in the country in a casual way\", and that viewers should \"get ready to burst into laughter and break down in tears\". Aguslia, writing for Tempo, said that it was better than the 2010 Citra Award winner 3 Hati Dua Dunia, Satu Cinta, which had similar themes. Kartoyo DS, reviewing for Suara Karya after a press screening, praised the plot, visuals, and music.Benny Benke, writing for the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray tolerance in Indonesia without making the subject seem clich√©; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra\\'s conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its social commentary was much needed, considering Indonesia\\'s religious turmoil. He also noted that the characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.\\n\\nAfter the release of ?, extremist group Islamic Defenders Front (Front Pembela Islam, or FPI) demonstrated against the film, owing to its pluralist message. Banser, the youth wing of the NU, also protested the film, taking offence to a scene in which Banser members are paid to do their charitable duties; they insisted that they are not. Meanwhile, the head of the Center For Culture of the Indonesian Ulema Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, or MUI) Cholil Ridwan stated that \"the film clearly propagates religious pluralism\". Protests also erupted when SCTV announced plans to show ? during Eid al-Fitr in 2011; the FPI organised a demonstration in front of the station\\'s office, in which hundreds of its members called for further cuts to the film. The network later decided against showing the film in a decision which was heavily criticised and seen as \"giving in\" to the FPI.In response to the criticism of ?, Minister of Culture and Tourism Jero Wacik expressed that the film would be best titled Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (\"Unity in Diversity\", the Indonesian national motto), and that its depiction of inter-ethnic and interfaith tolerance reflected Indonesia\\'s \"national character\". Yenny Wahid, a religious activist and daughter of former president and noted pluralist Abdurrahman Wahid, said that ? had \"succeeded in conveying the ideas of pluralism in Indonesia\", and that critics should not look at it in fragments. Although initially tweeting that the protests were free promotion, Bramantyo later entered discussions with the MUI and agreed to cut some scenes to avoid protests. In an October 2011 interview, he said he was \"bewildered\" that the film was poorly received by Muslims.\\n\\n? received 9 nominations at the 2011 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one Citra Award for Best Cinematography. Together with Ifa Isfansyah\\'s Sang Penari and Benni Setiawan\\'s Masih Bukan Cinta Biasa (Still Not Just an Ordinary Love), it was the most-nominated film of the year; however, ? received the least Citra Awards of the three. Sang Penari won two of the awards for which ? had been nominated, including Best Director, while Masih Bukan Cinta Biasa took Best Sound and Kamila Andini\\'s The Mirror Never Lies bested ? for Best Original Story. In 2012 ? was nominated for three awards at the Bandung Film Festival, winning none; all three awards were taken by The Mirror Never Lies.\\n\\n')]"

bramantyo who is of mixed chinesejavanese descent he decided to direct a pluralistthemed film based on his own experiences as a mixedrace child he chose the title  to avoid protests upon the films release saying that if it had been named liberalism or pluralism there would be protests by opponents of those ideologies and that he could not think of a better title the individual characters are based on people bramantyo has known or read about his goal in making the film was to clarify misleading arguments about islam and counter the portrayal of islam as a radical religion in a prerelease press conference bramantyo said that  was not meant to be commercial but to make a statement the film his fourteenth is one of several islamthemed movies he has directed after the polygamous romantic drama ayatayat cinta the verses of love 2008 and the biopic sang pencerah the enlightener 2009 fearing that the theme of pluralism would be taken as a battle cry some investors abandoned their commitments bramantyo was also unable to find support from mainstream studios before screening the film for the indonesian film censor board several scenes were cut including one in which a pigs head was displayed in the window of suns restaurant other scenes that raised commentary were kept although trimmed prior to the films release bramantyo consulted about twenty people including several religious leaders in an attempt to ensure that the film was not offensive titien wattimena was brought in to work further with the script she put more emphasis on the message of tolerancemahaka pictures owned by the same group as the predominantly muslim republika coproduced the film with dapur film the director of mahaka pictures erick thohir stated that his company had assisted with production because he was disturbed by the fact that indonesian films have declined in quality he was willing to work with bramantyo as he found that the latter had proven to be a skilled director of religious films through his earlier work filming began on 5 january 2011 in semarang bramantyo later described the city as a good example of tolerance in action the film reportedly cost rp 5 billion 600000 to produce two songs by the indonesian band sheila on 7 pasti kubisa sure i can and kamus hidupku dictionary to my life were used in the soundtrack while satrio budiono and saft daultsyah handled sound editingmulyo hadi purnomo based in semarang was tasked with casting the minor roles bramantyo contacted the main cast members directly agus kuncoro who had acted in sang pencerah and was known for playing in islamicthemed films agreed to play surya in  immediately after reading the script singer glenn fredly was interested in playing doni because he considered the character an ultraconservative catholic an interesting role given the sensitive religious situation in the country revalina s temat who had appeared in bramantyos 2009 film perempuan berkalung sorban the girl with the keffiyeh around her neck found her role as menuk interesting and more serious than her recent work in horror films endhita whom bramantyo called for the role expressed interest as soon as she received an outline of the plot  ade irwansyah writing for tabloid bintang notes that the film is a microcosm of indonesia which has numerous religious groups that often come into conflict irwansyah writes that bramantyo intended for viewers to think of the religious conflicts that happen daily and how to deal with differences in culture and beliefs while bramantyo has called the film his own personal interpretation of the countrys religious situation the film critic eric sasono noted this was apparent from the films tagline is it still important that we are different and suggested that bramantyo feared that indonesia was becoming a monolithic state according to sasono the conflict in  is settled when the characters begin believing that all religions are good and all praise god thus all religious conflict would end if people were to accept other beliefsthe jakarta globe describes the film as a study of the role and state of islam in modern indonesian society sasono noted that the muslim majority in the film did not have their motives shown explicitly be it for the use of the racist term cino or for attacking suns restaurant after comparing the actions of muslim groups in  and asrul sanis films al kautsar 1977 and titian serambut dibelah tujuh titian serambut divided by seven 1982 sasono suggested that bramantyo may have been expressing a fear that these groups no longer needed provocateurs to attack others he notes that a scene in which a catholic priest is stabbed by two men on a motorcycle reflects a september 2010 case in bekasi which had become a national issue he further describes the camera angles as vulgar abandoning subtlety but suggests that they made the work more dramatic he indicates that this was readily apparent with a scene in which part of a mosque falls apart   debuted at gandaria city in south jakarta on 31 march 2011 with a wide release on 7 april its release coincided with a contest sponsored by a local cellular service provider that

       " ('0.999...',\n",
       "  'in mathematics 0999 also written as 09 09 or 09 is a notation for the repeating decimal consisting of an unending sequence of 9s after the decimal point this repeating decimal is a numeral that represents the smallest number no less than every number in the sequence 09 099 0999  that is the supremum of this sequence this number is equal to 1 in other words 0999 is not almost exactly or very very nearly but not quite 1\\u200a  \\u2009rather 0999 and 1 represent exactly the same number there are many ways of showing this equality from intuitive arguments to mathematically rigorous proofs  the technique used depends on the target audience background assumptions historical context and preferred development of the real numbers the system within which 0999 is commonly defined in other systems 0999 can have the same meaning a different definition or be undefined more generally every nonzero terminating decimal has two equal representations for example 832 and 831999 which is a property of all positional numeral system representations regardless of base the utilitarian preference for the terminating decimal representation contributes to the misconception that it is the only representation  for this and other reasonssuch as rigorous proofs relying on nonelementary techniques properties or disciplinessome people can find the equality sufficiently counterintuitive that they question or reject it  this has been the subject of several studies in mathematics education  there is an elementary proof of the equation 0999  1 which uses just the mathematical tools of comparison and addition of finite decimal numbers without any reference to more advanced topics such as series limits formal construction of real numbers etc the proof given below is a direct formalization of the intuitive fact that if one draws 09 099 0999 etc on the number line there is no room left for placing a number between them and 1 the meaning of the notation 0999 is the least point on the number line lying to the right of all of the numbers 09 099 0999 etc because there is ultimately no room between 1 and these numbers the point 1 must be this least point and so 0999  1  if one places 09 099 0999 etc on the number line one sees immediately that all these points are to the left of 1 and that they get closer and closer to 1 more precisely the distance from 09 to 1 is 01  110 the distance from 099 to 1 is 001  1102 and so on the distance to 1 from the nth point the one with n 9s after the decimal point is 110n therefore if 1 were not the smallest number greater than 09 099 0999 etc then there would be a point on the number line that lies between 1 and all these points this point would be at a positive distance from 1 that is less than 110n for every integer n   in the standard number systems the rational numbers and the real numbers there is no positive number that is less than 110n for all n  this is one version of the archimedean property which can be proven to hold in the system of rational numbers  therefore 1 is the smallest number that is greater than all 09 099 0999 etc and so 1  0999  part of what this argument shows is that there is a least upper bound of the sequence 09 099 0999 etc the smallest number that is greater than all of the terms of the sequence  one of the axioms of the real number system is the completeness axiom which states that every bounded sequence has a least upper bound  this least upper bound is one way to define infinite decimal expansions the real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations  the argument here does not need to assume completeness to be valid because it shows that this particular sequence of rational numbers has a least upper bound and that this least upper bound is equal to one  the previous explanation is not a proof as one cannot define properly the relationship between a number and its representation as a point on the number line for the accuracy of the proof the number 09999 with n nines after the decimal point is denoted 09n thus 091  09 092  099 093  0999 and so on as 110n  0001 with n digits after the decimal point the addition rule for decimal numbers implies  and  for every positive integer n one has to show that 1 is the smallest number that is no less than all 09n for this it suffices to prove that if a number x is not larger than 1 and no less than all 09n then x  1 so let x such that  for every positive integer n therefore  which using basic arithmetic and the first equality established above simplifies to  this implies that the difference between 1 and x is less than the inverse of any positive integer thus this difference must be zero and thus x  1 that is  this proof relies on the fact that zero is the only nonnegative number that is less than all inverses of integers or equivalently that there is no number that is larger than every integer this is the archimedean property that is verified for rational numbers and real numbers real numbers may be enlarged into number systems such as hyperreal numbers with infinitely small numbers infinitesimals and infinitely large numbers infinite numbers when using such systems notation 0999 is generally not used as there is no smallest number that is no less than all 09n this  is implied by the fact that 09n  x  1 implies 09n1  2x  1  x  1  many algebraic arguments have been provided which suggest that                         1                  0999                          displaystyle 10999ldots     they are not mathematical proofs since they are typically based on the fact that the rules for adding and multiplying finite decimals extend to infinite decimals this is true but the proof is essentially the same as the proof of                         1                  0999                          displaystyle 10999ldots     so all these arguments are essentially circular reasoning nevertheless the matter of overly simplified illustrations of the equality is a subject of pedagogical discussion and critique  byers 2007 p 39 discusses the argument that in elementary school one is taught that 130333 so ignoring all essential subtleties multiplying this identity by 3 gives 10999  he further says that this argument is unconvincing because of an unresolved ambiguity over the meaning of the equals sign a student might think it surely does not mean that the number 1 is identical to that which is meant by the notation 0999 most undergraduate mathematics majors encountered by byers feel that while 0999 is very close to 1 on the strength of this argument with some even saying that it is infinitely close they are not ready to say that it is equal to 1 richman 1999 discusses how this argument gets its force from the fact that most people have been indoctrinated to accept the first equation without thinking but also suggests that the argument may lead skeptics to question this assumption byers also presents the following argument  students who did not accept the first argument sometimes accept the second argument but in byerss opinion still have not resolved the ambiguity and therefore do not understand the representation for infinite decimals peressini  peressini 2007 presenting the same argument also state that it does not explain the equality indicating that such an explanation would likely involve concepts of infinity and completeness  baldwin  norton 2012 citing katz  katz 2010a also conclude that the treatment of the identity based on such arguments as these without the formal concept of a limit is prematurethe same argument is also given by richman 1999 who notes that skeptics may question whether x is cancellable   that is whether it makes sense to subtract x from both sides  since the question of 0999 does not affect the formal development of mathematics it can be postponed until one proves the standard theorems of real analysis one requirement is to characterize real numbers that can be written in decimal notation consisting of an optional sign a finite sequence of one or more digits forming an integer part a decimal separator and a sequence of digits forming a fractional part for the purpose of discussing 0999 the integer part can be summarized as b0 and one can neglect negatives so a decimal expansion has the form  the fraction part unlike the integer part is not limited to finitely many digits this is a positional notation so for example the digit 5 in 500 contributes ten times as much as the 5 in 50 and the 5 in 005 contributes one tenth as much as the 5 in 05  a common development of decimal expansions is to define them as sums of infinite series in general  for 0999 one can apply the convergence theorem concerning geometric series stating that if                                                      r                                               1                 displaystyle r1    then since 0999 is such a sum with a  9 and common ratio r  110 the theorem makes short work of the question  this proof appears as early as 1770 in leonhard eulers elements of algebrathe sum of a geometric series is itself a result even older than euler a typical 18thcentury derivation used a termbyterm manipulation similar to the algebraic proof given above and as late as 1811 bonnycastles textbook an introduction to algebra uses such an argument for geometric series to justify the same maneuver on 0999 a 19thcentury reaction against such liberal summation methods resulted in the definition that still dominates today the sum of a series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums a corresponding proof of the theorem explicitly computes that sequence it can be found in any proofbased introduction to calculus or analysisa sequence x0 x1 x2  has the value x as its limit if the distance x  xn becomes arbitrarily small as n increases the statement that 0999  1 can itself be interpreted and proven as a limit the first two equalities can be interpreted as symbol shorthand definitions the remaining equalities can be proven the last step that 110n  0 as n   is often justified by the archimedean property of the real numbers this limitbased attitude towards 0999 is often put in more evocative but less precise terms for example the 1846 textbook the university arithmetic explains 999  continued to infinity  1 because every annexation of a 9 brings the value closer to 1 the 1895 arithmetic for schools says when a large number of 9s is taken the difference between 1 and 99999 becomes inconceivably small such heuristics are often incorrectly interpreted by students as implying that 0999 itself is less than 1  the series definition above is a simple way to define the real number named by a decimal expansion a complementary approach is tailored to the opposite process for a given real number define the decimal expansions to name it if a real number x is known to lie in the closed interval 0 10 that is it is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10 one can imagine dividing that interval into ten pieces that overlap only at their endpoints 0 1 1 2 2 3 and so on up to 9 10 the number x must belong to one of these if it belongs to 2 3 then one records the digit 2 and subdivides that interval into 2 21 21 22  28 29 29 3 continuing this process yields an infinite sequence of nested intervals labeled by an infinite sequence of digits b0 b1 b2 b3  and one writes  in this formalism the identities 1  0999 and 1  1000 reflect respectively the fact that 1 lies in both 0 1 and 1 2 so one can choose either subinterval when finding its digits to ensure that this notation does not abuse the  sign one needs a way to reconstruct a unique real number for each decimal this can be done with limits but other constructions continue with the ordering themeone straightforward choice is the nested intervals theorem which guarantees that given a sequence of nested closed intervals whose lengths become arbitrarily small the intervals contain exactly one real number in their intersection so b0b1b2b3 is defined to be the unique number contained within all the intervals b0 b0  1 b0b1 b0b1  01 and so on 0999 is then the unique real number that lies in all of the intervals 0 1 09 1 099 1 and 0999 1 for every finite string of 9s since 1 is an element of each of these intervals 0999  1the nested intervals theorem is usually founded upon a more fundamental characteristic of the real numbers the existence of least upper bounds or suprema to directly exploit these objects one may define b0b1b2b3 to be the least upper bound of the set of approximants b0 b0b1 b0b1b2  one can then show that this definition or the nested intervals definition is consistent with the subdivision procedure implying 0999  1 again tom apostol concludes  the fact that a real number might have two different decimal representations is merely a reflection of the fact that two different sets of real numbers can have the same supremum  some approaches explicitly define real numbers to be certain structures built upon the rational numbers using axiomatic set theory the natural numbers  0 1 2 3 and so on  begin with 0 and continue upwards so that every number has a successor one can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers and to further extend to ratios giving the rational numbers these number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition subtraction multiplication and division more subtly they include ordering so that one number can be compared to another and found to be less than greater than or equal to another number the step from rationals to reals is a major extension there are at least two popular ways to achieve this step both published in 1872 dedekind cuts and cauchy sequences proofs that 0999  1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis where the modern trend for the last few decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis even when a construction is offered it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of the real numbers which then support the above proofs however several authors express the idea that starting with a construction is more logically appropriate and the resulting proofs are more selfcontained  in the dedekind cut approach each real number x is defined as the infinite set of all rational numbers less than x in particular the real number 1 is the set of all rational numbers that are less than 1 every positive decimal expansion easily determines a dedekind cut the set of rational numbers which are less than some stage of the expansion so the real number 0999 is the set of rational numbers r such that r  0 or r  09 or r  099 or r is less than some other number of the form every element of 0999 is less than 1 so it is an element of the real number 1 conversely all elements of 1 are rational numbers that can be written as  with b  0 and b  a this implies  and thus  since  by the definition above every element of 1 is also an element of 0999 and combined with the proof above that every element of 0999 is also an element of 1 the sets 0999 and 1 contain the same rational numbers and are therefore the same set that is 0999  1 the definition of real numbers as dedekind cuts was first published by richard dedekind in 1872 the above approach to assigning a real number to each decimal expansion is due to an expository paper titled is 0999   1 by fred richman in mathematics magazine richman notes that taking dedekind cuts in any dense subset of the rational numbers yields the same results in particular he uses decimal fractions for which the proof is more immediate he also notes that typically the definitions allow  x  x  1   to be a cut but not  x  x  1   or vice versa why do that precisely to rule out the existence of distinct numbers 09 and 1  so we see that in the traditional definition of the real numbers the equation 09  1 is built in at the beginning a further modification of the procedure leads to a different structure where the two are not equal although it is consistent many of the common rules of decimal arithmetic no longer hold for example the fraction 13 has no representation see  alternative number systems below  another approach is to define a real number as the limit of a cauchy sequence of rational numbers this construction of the real numbers uses the ordering of rationals less directly first the distance between x and y is defined as the absolute value x  y where the absolute value z is defined as the maximum of z and z thus never negative then the reals are defined to be the sequences of rationals that have the cauchy sequence property using this distance that is in the sequence x0 x1 x2  a mapping from natural numbers to rationals for any positive rational  there is an n such that  xm  xn   for all m n  n the distance between terms becomes smaller than any positive rationalif xn and yn are two cauchy sequences then they are defined to be equal as real numbers if the sequence xn  yn has the limit 0 truncations of the decimal number b0b1b2b3 generate a sequence of rationals which is cauchy this is taken to define the real value of the number thus in this formalism the task is to show that the sequence of rational numbers  has limit 0 considering the nth term of the sequence for                         n                             n                          displaystyle nin mathbb n     it must therefore be shown that  this can be proved from the definition of a limit so again 0999  1the definition of real numbers as cauchy sequences was first published separately by eduard heine and georg cantor also in 1872 the above approach to decimal expansions including the proof that 0999  1 closely follows griffiths  hiltons 1970 work a comprehensive textbook of classical mathematics a contemporary interpretation  commonly in secondary schools mathematics education the real numbers are constructed by defining a number using an integer followed by a radix point and an infinite sequence written out as a string to represent the fractional part of any given real number in this construction the set of any combination of an integer and digits after the decimal point or radix point in nonbase 10 systems is the set of real numbers this construction can be rigorously shown to satisfy all of the real axioms after defining an equivalence relation over the set that defines 1 eq 0999 as well as for any other nonzero decimals with only finitely many nonzero terms in the decimal string with its trailing 9s version with this construction of the reals all proofs of the statement 1  0999 can be viewed as implicitly assuming equality when any operations are performed on the real numbers  one of the notions that can resolve the issue is the requirement that real numbers are densely ordered students are taking for granted that                         099999                 displaystyle 099999    is before                         1                 displaystyle 1    while this kind of intuitive ordering is better defined as purely lexicographical  the ordering of the real numbers is recognized as a dense order however depending on the context students can reconcile this property with the existence of numbers just before or after a given number 0999 is thus often seen as the predecessor of 1dense order requires that there is a third real value strictly between                         099999                 displaystyle 099999    and                         1                 displaystyle 1    but there is none we cannot change a single digit in either of the two to obtain such a number if                         099999                 displaystyle 099999    and                         1                 displaystyle 1    are to represent real numbers they have to be equal dense ordering implies that if there is no new element strictly between two elements of the set the two elements must be considered equal  the result that 0999  1 generalizes readily in two ways first every nonzero number with a finite decimal notation equivalently endless trailing 0s has a counterpart with trailing 9s for example 024999 equals 025 exactly as in the special case considered these numbers are exactly the decimal fractions and they are densesecond a comparable theorem applies in each radix or base for example in base 2 the binary numeral system 0111 equals 1 and in base 3 the ternary numeral system 0222 equals 1 in general any terminating base b expression has a counterpart with repeated trailing digits equal to b  1 textbooks of real analysis are likely to skip the example of 0999 and present one or both of these generalizations from the startalternative representations of 1 also occur in noninteger bases for example in the golden ratio base the two standard representations are 1000 and 0101010 and there are infinitely many more representations that include adjacent 1s generally for almost all q between 1 and 2 there are uncountably many baseq expansions of 1 on the other hand there are still uncountably many q including all natural numbers greater than 1 for which there is only one baseq expansion of 1 other than the trivial 1000 this result was first obtained by paul erds miklos horvth and istvn jo around 1990 in 1998 vilmos komornik and paola loreti determined the smallest such base the komornikloreti constant q  1787231650 in this base 1  011010011001011010010110011010011 the digits are given by the thuemorse sequence which does not repeata more farreaching generalization addresses the most general positional numeral systems they too have multiple representations and in some sense the difficulties are even worse for example in the balanced ternary system 12  0111  1111 in the reverse factorial number system using bases 2 3 4  for positions after the decimal point 1  1000  01234  that all these different number systems suffer from multiple representations for some real numbers can be attributed to a fundamental difference between the real numbers as an ordered set and collections of infinite strings of symbols ordered lexicographically indeed the following two properties account for the difficulty  if an interval of the real numbers is partitioned into two nonempty parts l r such that every element of l is strictly less than every element of r then either l contains a largest element or r contains a smallest element but not both the collection of infinite strings of symbols taken from any finite alphabet lexicographically ordered can be partitioned into two nonempty parts l r such that every element of l is less than every element of r while l contains the largest element and r contains the smallest element indeed it suffices to take two finite prefixes initial substrings p1 p2 of elements from the collection such that they differ only in their final symbol for which symbol they have successive values and take for l the set of all strings in the collection whose corresponding prefix is at most p1 and for r the remainder the strings in the collection whose corresponding prefix is at least p2 then l has the largest element starting with p1 and choosing the largest available symbol in all following positions while r has the smallest element obtained by following p2 by the smallest symbol in all positionsthe first point follows from the basic properties of real numbers l has a supremum and r has an infimum which are easily seen to be equal being a real number it either lies in r or in l but not both since l and r are supposed to be disjoint the second point generalizes the 09991000 pair obtained for p1  0 p2  1 in fact one need not use the same alphabet for all positions so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included or consider the full collection of possible strings the only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols which may even depend on the previous symbols can be chosen from this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string so one should not allow 9 in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of 9s under these assumptions the above argument shows that an order preserving map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a bijection either some numbers do not correspond to any string or some of them correspond to more than one string petkovek 1990 has proven that for any positional system that names all the real numbers the set of reals with multiple representations is always dense he calls the proof an instructive exercise in elementary pointset topology it involves viewing sets of positional values as stone spaces and noticing that their real representations are given by continuous functions  one application of 0999 as a representation of 1 occurs in elementary number theory in 1802 h goodwin published an observation on the appearance of 9s in the repeatingdecimal representations of fractions whose denominators are certain prime numbers examples include  17  0142857 and 142  857  999 173  001369863 and 0136  9863  9999e midy proved a general result about such fractions now called midys theorem in 1836 the publication was obscure and it is unclear if his proof directly involved 0999 but at least one modern proof by w g leavitt does if it can be proved that if a decimal of the form 0b1b2b3 is a positive integer then it must be 0999 which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors modular arithmetic fermat primes order of group elements and quadratic reciprocity returning to real analysis the base3 analogue 0222  1 plays a key role in the characterization of one of the simplest fractals the middlethirds cantor set  a point in the unit interval lies in the cantor set if and only if it can be represented in ternary using only the digits 0 and 2the nth digit of the representation reflects the position of the point in the nth stage of the construction for example the point 23 is given the usual representation of 02 or 02000 since it lies to the right of the first deletion and to the left of every deletion thereafter the point 13 is represented not as 01 but as 00222 since it lies to the left of the first deletion and to the right of every deletion thereafterrepeating nines also turns up in yet another of georg cantors works they must be taken into account to construct a valid proof applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions of the uncountability of the unit interval such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions so one needs to avoid pairs like 02 and 01999 a simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions the opposite method rules out repeating nines a variant that may be closer to cantors original argument uses base 2 and by turning base3 expansions into base2 expansions one can prove the uncountability of the cantor set as well  students of mathematics often reject the equality of 0999 and 1 for reasons ranging from their disparate appearance to deep misgivings over the limit concept and disagreements over the nature of infinitesimals there are many common contributing factors to the confusion  students are often mentally committed to the notion that a number can be represented in one and only one way by a decimal seeing two manifestly different decimals representing the same number appears to be a paradox which is amplified by the appearance of the seemingly wellunderstood number 1 some students interpret 0999 or similar notation as a large but finite string of 9s possibly with a variable unspecified length if they accept an infinite string of nines they may still expect a last 9 at infinity intuition and ambiguous teaching lead students to think of the limit of a sequence as a kind of infinite process rather than a fixed value since a sequence need not reach its limit where students accept the difference between a sequence of numbers and its limit they might read 0999 as meaning the sequence rather than its limitthese ideas are mistaken in the context of the standard real numbers although some may be valid in other number systems either invented for their general mathematical utility or as instructive counterexamples to better understand 0999 many of these explanations were found by david tall who has studied characteristics of teaching and cognition that lead to some of the misunderstandings he has encountered with his college students interviewing his students to determine why the vast majority initially rejected the equality he found that students continued to conceive of 0999 as a sequence of numbers getting closer and closer to 1 and not a fixed value because you havent specified how many places there are or it is the nearest possible decimal below 1the elementary argument of multiplying 0333  13 by 3 can convince reluctant students that 0999  1 still when confronted with the conflict between their belief in the first equation and their disbelief in the second some students either begin to disbelieve the first equation or simply become frustrated nor are more sophisticated methods foolproof students who are fully capable of applying rigorous definitions may still fall back on intuitive images when they are surprised by a result in advanced mathematics including 0999 for example one real analysis student was able to prove that 0333  13 using a supremum definition but then insisted that 0999  1 based on her earlier understanding of long division others still can prove that 13  0333 but upon being confronted by the fractional proof insist that logic supersedes the mathematical calculations mazur 2005 tells the tale of an otherwise brilliant calculus student of his who challenged almost everything i said in class but never questioned his calculator and who had come to believe that nine digits are all one needs to do mathematics including calculating the square root of 23 the student remained uncomfortable with a limiting argument that 999  10 calling it a wildly imagined infinite growing processas part of ed dubinskys apos theory of mathematical learning he and his collaborators 2005 propose that students who conceive of 0999 as a finite indeterminate string with an infinitely small distance from 1 have not yet constructed a complete process conception of the infinite decimal other students who have a complete process conception of 0999 may not yet be able to encapsulate that process into an object conception like the object conception they have of 1 and so they view the process 0999 and the object 1 as incompatible dubinsky et al also link this mental ability of encapsulation to viewing 13 as a number in its own right and to dealing with the set of natural numbers as a whole  with the rise of the internet debates about 0999 have become commonplace on newsgroups and message boards including many that nominally have little to do with mathematics in the newsgroup scimath arguing over 0999 is described as a popular sport and it is one of the questions answered in its faq the faq briefly covers 13 multiplication by 10 and limits and it alludes to cauchy sequences as well a 2003 edition of the generalinterest newspaper column the straight dope discusses 0999 via 13 and limits saying of misconceptions  the lower primate in us still resists saying 999 doesnt really represent a number then but a process to find a number we have to halt the process at which point the 999  1 thing falls apart nonsense a slate article reports that the concept of 0999 is hotly disputed on websites ranging from world of warcraft message boards to ayn rand forums in the same vein the question of 0999 proved such a popular topic in the first seven years of blizzard entertainments battlenet forums that the company issued a press release on april fools day 2004 that it is 1  we are very excited to close the book on this subject once and for all weve witnessed the heartache and concern over whether 999 does or does not equal 1 and were proud that the following proof finally and conclusively addresses the issue for our customers  two proofs are then offered based on limits and multiplication by 10 0999 features also in mathematical jokes such as  q how many mathematicians does it take to screw in a lightbulb a 0999999  although the real numbers form an extremely useful number system the decision to interpret the notation 0999 as naming a real number is ultimately a convention and timothy gowers argues in mathematics a very short introduction that the resulting identity 0999  1 is a convention as well  however it is by no means an arbitrary convention because not adopting it forces one either to invent strange new objects or to abandon some of the familiar rules of arithmetic  some proofs that 0999  1 rely on the archimedean property of the real numbers that there are no nonzero infinitesimals specifically the difference 1  0999 must be smaller than any positive rational number so it must be an infinitesimal but since the reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals the difference is therefore zero and therefore the two values are the same however there are mathematically coherent ordered algebraic structures including various alternatives to the real numbers which are nonarchimedean nonstandard analysis provides a number system with a full array of infinitesimals and their inverses a h lightstone developed a decimal expansion for hyperreal numbers in 0 1 lightstone shows how to associate to each number a sequence of digits  indexed by the hypernatural numbers while he does not directly discuss 0999 he shows the real number 13 is represented by 0333333 which is a consequence of the transfer principle as a consequence the number 0999999  1 with this type of decimal representation not every expansion represents a number in particular 0333000 and 0999000 do not correspond to any number the standard definition of the number 0999 is the limit of the sequence 09 099 0999   a different definition involves what terry tao refers to as ultralimit ie the equivalence class 09 099 0999  of this sequence in the ultrapower construction which is a number that falls short of 1 by an infinitesimal amount more generally the hyperreal number uh0999999000 with last digit 9 at infinite hypernatural rank h satisfies a strict inequality uh  1 accordingly an alternative interpretation for zero followed by infinitely many 9s could be  all such interpretations of 0999 are infinitely close to 1 ian stewart characterizes this interpretation as an entirely reasonable way to rigorously justify the intuition that theres a little bit missing from 1 in 0999 along with katz  katz robert ely also questions the assumption that students ideas about 0999  1 are erroneous intuitions about the real numbers interpreting them rather as nonstandard intuitions that could be valuable in the learning of calculus  combinatorial game theory provides alternative reals as well with infinite bluered hackenbush as one particularly relevant example in 1974 elwyn berlekamp described a correspondence between hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers motivated by the idea of data compression for example the value of the hackenbush string lrrlrlrl is 00101012  13 however the value of lrlll corresponding to 01112 is infinitesimally less than 1 the difference between the two is the surreal number 1 where  is the first infinite ordinal the relevant game is lrrrr or 00002this is in fact true of the binary expansions of many rational numbers where the values of the numbers are equal but the corresponding binary tree paths are different for example 0101112  0110002 which are both equal to 34 but the first representation corresponds to the binary tree path lrlrlll while the second corresponds to the different path lrllrrr  another manner in which the proofs might be undermined is if 1  0999 simply does not exist because subtraction is not always possible mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include commutative semigroups commutative monoids and semirings richman considers two such systems designed so that 0999  1 first richman defines a nonnegative decimal number to be a literal decimal expansion he defines the lexicographical order and an addition operation noting that 0999  1 simply because 0  1 in the ones place but for any nonterminating x one has 0999  x  1  x so one peculiarity of the decimal numbers is that addition cannot always be cancelled another is that no decimal number corresponds to 13 after defining multiplication the decimal numbers form a positive totally ordered commutative semiringin the process of defining multiplication richman also defines another system he calls cut d which is the set of dedekind cuts of decimal fractions ordinarily this definition leads to the real numbers but for a decimal fraction d he allows both the cut  d and the principal cut  d the result is that the real numbers are living uneasily together with the decimal fractions again 0999  1 there are no positive infinitesimals in cut d but there is a sort of negative infinitesimal 0 which has no decimal expansion he concludes that 0999  1  0 while the equation 0999  x  1 has no solution  when asked about 0999 novices often believe there should be a final 9 believing 1  0999 to be a positive number which they write as 00001 whether or not that makes sense the intuitive goal is clear adding a 1 to the final 9 in 0999 would carry all the 9s into 0s and leave a 1 in the ones place among other reasons this idea fails because there is no final 9 in 0999 however there is a system that contains an infinite string of 9s including a last 9  the padic numbers are an alternative number system of interest in number theory like the real numbers the padic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via cauchy sequences the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p and much closer to pn than it is to 1 the padic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p including 10 so arithmetic can be performed in the padics and there are no infinitesimals in the 10adic numbers the analogues of decimal expansions run to the left the 10adic expansion 999 does have a last 9 and it does not have a first 9 one can add 1 to the ones place and it leaves behind only 0s after carrying through 1  999  000  0 and so 999  1 another derivation uses a geometric series the infinite series implied by 999 does not converge in the real numbers but it converges in the 10adics and so one can reuse the familiar formula  compare with the series above a third derivation was invented by a seventhgrader who was doubtful over her teachers limiting argument that 0999  1 but was inspired to take the multiplyby10 proof above in the opposite direction if x  999 then 10x   990 so 10x  x  9 hence x  1 againas a final extension since 0999  1 in the reals and 999  1 in the 10adics then by blind faith and unabashed juggling of symbols one may add the two equations and arrive at 999999  0 this equation does not make sense either as a 10adic expansion or an ordinary decimal expansion but it turns out to be meaningful and true in the doubly infinite decimal expansion of the 10adic solenoid with eventually repeating left ends to represent the real numbers and eventually repeating right ends to represent the 10adic numbers  zenos paradoxes particularly the paradox of the runner are reminiscent of the apparent paradox that 0999 and 1 are equal the runner paradox can be mathematically modelled and then like 0999 resolved using a geometric series however it is not clear if this mathematical treatment addresses the underlying metaphysical issues zeno was exploring division by zero occurs in some popular discussions of 0999 almost all modern treatments leave division by zero undefined as it can be given no meaning in the standard real numbers however division by zero is defined in some other systems such as complex analysis where the extended complex plane ie the riemann sphere has a point at infinity here it makes sense to define 10 to be infinity and in fact the results are profound and applicable to many problems in engineering and physics leonard euler argued for such a definition long before either number system was developed negative zero is another redundant feature of many ways of writing numbers in number systems such as the real numbers where 0 denotes the additive identity and is neither positive nor negative the usual interpretation of 0 is that it should denote the additive inverse of 0 which forces 0  0 nonetheless some scientific applications use separate positive and negative zeroes as do some computing binary number systems for example integers stored in the sign and magnitude or ones complement formats or floating point numbers as specified by the ieee floatingpoint standard    '),\n",

       "  'in mathematics 1  2  3  4   is an infinite series whose terms are the successive positive integers given alternating signs using sigma summation notation the sum of the first m terms of the series can be expressed as  the infinite series diverges meaning that its sequence of partial sums 1 1 2 2 3  does not tend towards any finite limit nonetheless in the mid18th century leonhard euler wrote what he admitted to be a paradoxical equation  a rigorous explanation of this equation would not arrive until much later starting in 1890 ernesto cesro mile borel and others investigated welldefined methods to assign generalized sums to divergent seriesincluding new interpretations of eulers attempts many of these summability methods easily assign to 1  2  3  4   a value of 14 cesro summation is one of the few methods that do not sum 1  2  3  4   so the series is an example where a slightly stronger method such as abel summation is required the series 1  2  3  4   is closely related to grandis series 1  1  1  1   euler treated these two as special cases of the more general sequence 1  2n  3n  4n   where n  1 and n  0 respectively this line of research extended his work on the basel problem and leading towards the functional equations of what are now known as the dirichlet eta function and the riemann zeta function  the series terms 1 2 3 4  do not approach 0 therefore 1  2  3  4   diverges by the term test divergence can also be shown directly from the definition an infinite series converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums converges to limit in which case that limit is the value of the infinite series the partial sums of 1  2  3  4   are  the sequence of partial sums shows that the series does not converge to a particular number for any proposed limit x there exists a point beyond which the subsequent partial sums are all outside the interval x1 x1 so 1  2  3  4   diverges the partial sums include every integer exactly onceeven 0 if one

definition of the sum of a divergent series is called a summation method or summability method there are many different methods and it is desirable that they share some properties of ordinary

since  such a method must also sum grandis series as 1  1  1  1    12  in 1891 ernesto cesro expressed hope that divergent series would be rigorously brought into calculus pointing out one already writes 1  1  1  1  2  1  2  3  4   and asserts that both the sides are equal to 14 for cesro this equation was an application of a theorem he had published the previous year which is the first theorem in the history of summable divergent series the details on his summation method are below the central idea is that 1  2  3  4   is the cauchy product discrete convolution of 1  1  1  1   with 1  1  1  1   the cauchy product of two infinite series is defined even when both of them are divergent in the case where an  bn  1n the terms of the cauchy product are given by the finite diagonal sums  the product series is then  thus a summation method that respects the cauchy product of two series  and assigns to the series 1  1  1  1   the sum 12  will also assign to the series 1  2  3  4   the sum 14 with the result of the previous section this implies an equivalence between summability of 1  1  1  1   and 1  2  3  4   with methods that are linear stable and respect the cauchy product cesros theorem is a subtle example the series 1  1  1  1   is cesrosummable in the weakest sense called c 1summable while 1  2  3  4   requires a stronger form of cesros theorem being c 2summable since all forms of cesros theorem are linear and stable the values of the sums are as calculated above    to find the c 1 cesro sum of 1  2  3  4   if it exists one needs to compute the arithmetic means of the partial sums of the series the partial sums are  and the arithmetic means of these partial sums are  this sequence of means does not converge so 1  2  3  4   is not cesro summable there are two wellknown generalizations of cesro summation the conceptually simpler of these is the sequence of h n methods for natural numbers n the h 1 sum is cesro summation and higher methods repeat the computation of means above the even means converge to 12 while the odd means are all equal to 0 so the means of the means converge to the average of 0 and 12 namely 14 so 1  2  3  4   is h 2 summable to 14 the h stands for otto hlder who first proved in 1882 what mathematicians now think of as the connection between abel summation and h n summation 1  2  3  4   was his first example the fact that 14 is the h 2 sum of 1  2  3  4   guarantees that it is the abel sum as well this will also be proved directly below the other commonly formulated generalization of cesro summation is the sequence of c n methods it has been proven that c n summation and h n summation always give the same results but they have different historical backgrounds in 1887 cesro came close to stating the definition of c n summation but he gave only a few examples in particular he summed 1  2  3  4   to 14 by a method that may be rephrased as c n but was not justified as such at the time he formally defined the c n methods in 1890 in order to state his theorem that the cauchy product of a c nsummable series and a c msummable series is c m  n  1summable  in a 1749 report leonhard euler admits that the series diverges but prepares to sum it anyway   when it is said that the sum of this series 1  2  3  4  5  6 etc is 14 that must appear paradoxical for by adding 100 terms of this series we get 50 however the sum of 101 terms gives 51 which is quite different from 14 and becomes still greater when one increases the number of terms but i have already noticed at a previous time that it is necessary to give to the word sum a more extended meaning  euler proposed a generalization of the word sum several times in the case of 1  2  3  4   his ideas are similar to what is now known as abel summation   it is no more doubtful that the sum of this series 1  2  3  4  5 etc is 14 since it arises from the expansion of the formula 1112 whose value is incontestably 14 the idea becomes clearer by considering the general series 1  2x  3x2  4x3  5x4  6x5  c that arises while expanding the expression 11x2 which this series is indeed equal to after we set x  1 there are many ways to see that at least for absolute values x  1 euler is right in that  one can take the taylor expansion of the righthand side or apply the formal long division process for polynomials starting from the lefthand side one can follow the general heuristics above and try multiplying by 1  x twice or squaring the geometric series 1  x  x2   euler also seems to suggest differentiating the latter series term by termin the modern view the generating function 1  2x  3x2  4x3   does not define a function at x  1 so that value cannot simply be substituted into the resulting expression since the function is defined for all x  1 one can still take the limit as x approaches 1 and this is the definition of the abel sum  euler applied another technique to the series the euler transform one of his own inventions to compute the euler transform one begins with the sequence of positive terms that makes up the alternating seriesin this case 1 2 3 4  the first element of this sequence is labeled a0 next one needs the sequence of forward differences among 1 2 3 4  this is just 1 1 1 1  the first element of this sequence is labeled a0 the euler transform also depends on differences of differences and higher iterations but all the forward differences among 1 1 1 1  are 0 the euler transform of 1  2  3  4   is then defined as  in modern terminology one says that 1  2  3  4   is euler summable to 14 the euler summability also implies borel summability with the same summation value as it does in general  saichev and woyczyski arrive at 1  2  3  4    14 by applying only two physical principles infinitesimal relaxation and separation of scales to be precise these principles lead them to define a broad family of summation methods all of which sum the series to 14  if x is a function whose first and second derivatives are continuous and integrable over 0  such that 0  1 and the limits of x and xx at  are both 0 then this result generalizes abel summation which is recovered by letting x  expx the general statement can be proved by pairing up the terms in the series over m and converting the expression into a riemann integral for the latter step the corresponding proof for 1  1  1  1   applies the mean value theorem but here one needs the stronger lagrange form of taylors theorem  the threefold cauchy product of 1  1  1  1   is 1  3  6  10   the alternating series of triangular numbers its abel and euler sum is 18 the fourfold cauchy product of 1  1  1  1   is 1  4  10  20   the alternating series of tetrahedral numbers whose abel sum is 116 another generalization of 1  2  3  4   in a slightly different direction is the series 1  2n  3n  4n   for other values of n for positive integers n these series have the following abel sums where bn are the bernoulli numbers for even n this reduces to  which can be interpreted as stating that negative even values of the riemann zeta function are zero this sum became an object of particular ridicule by niels henrik abel in 1826  divergent series are on the whole devils work and it is a shame that one dares to found any proof on them one can get out of them what one wants if one uses them and it is they which have made so much unhappiness and so many paradoxes can one think of anything more appalling than to say that  where n is a positive number heres something to laugh at friends cesros teacher eugne charles catalan also disparaged divergent series under catalans influence cesro initially referred to the conventional formulas for 1  2n  3n  4n   as absurd equalities and in 1883 cesro expressed a typical view of the time that the formulas were false but still somehow formally useful finally in his 1890 sur la multiplication des sries cesro took a modern approach starting from definitionsthe series are also studied for noninteger values of n these make up the dirichlet eta function part of eulers motivation for studying series related to 1  2  3  4   was the functional equation of the eta function which leads directly to the functional equation of the riemann zeta function euler had already become famous for finding the values of these functions at positive even integers including the basel problem and he was attempting to find the values at the positive odd integers including aprys constant as well a problem that remains elusive today the eta function in particular is easier to deal with by eulers methods because its dirichlet series is abel summable everywhere the zeta functions dirichlet series is much harder to sum where it diverges for example the counterpart of 1  2  3  4   in the zeta function is the nonalternating series 1  2  3  4   which has deep applications in modern physics but requires much stronger methods to sum  '),\n",
       " ('1 Line (Sound Transit)',\n",
       "  'the 1 line formerly central link is a light rail line in seattle washington united states and part of sound transits link light rail system it serves 19 stations in the cities of seattle seatac and tukwila traveling nearly 25 miles 40 km between northgate and angle lake stations the line connects the university district downtown seattle the rainier valley and seattletacoma international airport the 1 line carried over 25 million total passengers in 2019 with an average of nearly 80000 daily passengers on weekdays it runs for 20 hours per day on weekdays and saturdays with headways of up to six minutes during peak hours and reduced 18hour service on sundays and holidays trains are composed of two or more cars that each can carry 194 passengers including 74 in seats along with wheelchairs and bicycles fares are calculated based on distance traveled and are paid through the regional orca card paper tickets or a mobile app sound transit uses proofofpayment to verify passenger fares employing fare ambassadors and transit police to conduct random inspections all stations have ticket vending machines public art bicycle parking and bus connections while several also have parkandride lots voters approved central link in a 1996 ballot measure and construction began in 2003 after the project was reorganized under a new budget and truncated route in response to higher than expected costs the light rail line which followed decades of failed transit plans for the seattle region opened on july 18 2009 terminating at westlake in the downtown seattle transit tunnel and tukwila international boulevard near seatac airport it was extended south to seatacairport in december 2009 north to the university of washington in march 2016 and south to angle lake in september 2016 the line was temporarily renamed the red line until its designation was changed to the 1 line in 2021 coinciding with an extension to northgate further extensions to lynnwood and federal way are planned to open in 2024 and 2026 respectively the 2 line connecting seattle to the eastside suburbs will form a multiline network via its connection with the 1 line in 2025 further expansion under sound transit 3 will divide the current corridor between two lines the 1 line from ballard to tacoma and the 3 line from everett to west seattle    public transit service within seattle began in 1884 with the introduction of the citys first horsedrawn streetcar line the system had been replaced with a network of electric streetcars and cable cars by the end of the decade which spurred the development of new streetcar suburbs across modernday seattle interurban railways to everett tacoma and the rainier valley were established after the turn of the century giving the region an intercity passenger rail system to feed the streetcar lines the interurban system failed to compete with the increasing popularity of automobile travel capped by the completion of us route 99 in the late 1920s and was shut down by 1941 the streetcars had also been acquired by the municipal government and replaced with a trolleybus networkvarious proposals for a rapid transit system in seattle to replace the streetcarand later busnetworks were presented in the 20th century and rejected by city officials or voters due to their cost or other factors in 1911 urban planner virgil bogue proposed a 41mile 66 km system of subway tunnels and elevated railways as the centerpiece to a comprehensive plan for the city which was rejected by voters the seattle center monorail originally built for the 1962 worlds fair has been the subject of several unsuccessful expansion proposals backed by governor albert rosellini in the 1960s and seattle voters in the early 2000s the forward thrust committee of the late 1960s proposed a 47mile 76 km rapid transit system to connect downtown seattle to ballard the university district lake city capitol hill bellevue and renton the federal government offered to fund twothirds of the rail systems capital costs approximately 770 million equivalent to 497 billion in 2022 dollars if 385 million equivalent to 249 billion in 2022 dollars in local property taxes were approved by voters the rapid transit initiative was placed on the ballot in february 1968 but fell short of supermajority needed to pass a second attempt in may 1970 with 440 million equivalent to 257 billion in 2022 dollars in local funding and 870 million equivalent to 508 billion in 2022 dollars in federal funding failed amid a local economic downturn caused by layoffs at boeing the federal funding earmarked towards the rapid transit system was granted to atlanta georgia forming the initial funding for the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authoritys rail system  following the failed forward thrust initiatives metro transit was created in 1972 to oversee a countywide bus network and plan for a future rail system in the early 1980s metro transit and the puget sound council of governments pscog explored light rail and busway concepts to serve the region ultimately choosing to build a downtown transit tunnel that would be convertible from buses to light rail at a later date the pscog formally endorsed a light rail plan in 1986 recommending a system be built by 2020 and include a line between seattle and seatac airport with routing alternatives that served the rainier valley a 1988 advisory measure on light rail planning was passed in king county encouraging metro transit to accelerate the plans timeline to open by 2000 in 1990 the state legislature endorsed the creation of a regional transit board composed of politicians from king pierce and snohomish counties with the goal of implementing the regional transit plan several members of the seattle city council endorsed the rail plan on the condition that it pass through the rainier valley by then an economically disadvantaged and majorityminority neighborhoodthe central puget sound regional transit authority later renamed sound transit was created in 1993 to write and present a regional transit plan for voter approval the agency proposed a 70mile 110 km light rail network as the centerpiece of a 67 billion transit ballot measure with a surface line through the rainier valley and tunnels between downtown seattle capitol hill and the university district the ballot measure failed to pass on march 14 1995 and the light rail line was shortened to 25 miles 40 km between the university district and seatac airport voters approved the 39 billion package on november 5 1996 along with increases to sales taxes and motor vehicle excise taxes across the regional transit district sound transit considered several routing options during a series of public hearings and studies early into the projects environmental impact study which adopted the name central link in 1999 sound transit selected the alignment for the light rail project consisting of a line between the university district and seatac airport with surface segments passing through tukwila the rainier valley and sodo and tunnels under beacon hill first hill capitol hill and portage bay  the central link project was originally planned to open in 2006 and projected to cost 19 billion equivalent to 329 billion in 2022 dollars but the estimates were found to be unrealistic by auditors in november 2000 new executives hired by sound transit to replace previous program directors presented a revised plan with an opening date pushed back three years to 2009 and a 38 billion equivalent to 617 billion in 2022 dollars cost estimate planning of the portage bay tunnel between capitol hill and the university district was suspended due to higher than expected contractor bids attributed to difficult soil conditions sound transit adopted the revised budget and schedule in january 2001 including provisions to restudy routing options between downtown seattle and the university district along with a 500 million federal grant agreement to fund the construction of an initial segment for the project the initial segment identified and approved by sound transit later that year shortened the line to 14 miles 23 km between downtown seattle and a southern tukwila station near seatac airport the remaining routes to the airport and university district were sent back to the planning stage and reorganized into separate light rail projectsin november 2001 sound transit approved construction of the shortened central link light rail project calling for a summer 2002 groundbreaking property acquisition in the rainier valley began in march 2002 but two legal battles delayed the start of construction in november 2002 the king county superior court ruled in favor of sound transit in a lawsuit filed by light rail opponents alleging that it lacked the authority to shorten a voterapproved line the approval of tim eymans initiative 776 threatened to repeal motor vehicle excise taxes needed to fund sound transits budget but was declared unconstitutional in february 2003 another routing change requested by the city of tukwila placing light rail tracks along freeways in lieu of international boulevard was approved by sound transit and the federal transit administration in 2002 moving the project closer to construction  sound transit received its 500 million federal grant agreement in october 2003 and a groundbreaking ceremony was held in sodo on november 8 2003 construction contracts for various segments were awarded in 2004 and 2005 coming six percent under sound transits estimates and work began along all parts of the system the first rails were installed on august 18 2005 in the sodo area a month later the downtown transit tunnel closed for a twoyear renovation to accommodate light rail service excavation of the beacon hill tunnel and station began in 2005 and two tunnel boring machines were launched in early 2006 to bore the twin tunnels between sodo and the rainier valleythe sodo and stadium stations were completed in may 2006 and light rail testing in the sodo area began the following march testing was extended to the reopened downtown transit tunnel in september 2007 initially limited to weekends without bus service and further to the rainier valley after the completion of the beacon hill tunnel in 2008 the elevated guideway in tukwila including crossings over major freeways and the duwamish river was completed in 2007 after the installation of 2457 precast concrete segments and balanced cantilever bridges during construction in the rainier valley sound transit and the city of seattle offered 50 million in mitigation funds and development opportunities to affected businesses construction of light rail along martin luther king jr way south also resulted in utility lines being moved underground improved sidewalks street crossings and landscaping  central link was opened on july 18 2009 with a community celebration that attracted more than 92000 riders over the first weekend of free service trains began operating on the 139mile 224 km segment between westlake and tukwila international boulevard stations along with a bus shuttle to serve seatac airport from tukwila the 17mile 27 km extension to seatacairport station opened on december 19 2009 replacing the shuttle and other bus services to the airport sound transit added lubrication equipment and rubber mats to segments in tukwila and the rainier valley in 2010 to reduce noise levels that had reached up to 83 decibels surpassing federal safety standards and triggering noise complaints from nearby residents a contract dispute with the rainier valley construction contractor was settled in 2011 bringing the projects total price to 117 million below the 244 billion budget the opening of light rail service to the rainier valley spurred new transitoriented development which had initially stalled during the great recession but recovered in the mid2010scentral link train service was increased to a frequency of 6 minutes during peak hours from 75 minutes in 2015 to prepare for the opening of the university link extension the line was extended north to university of washington station via capitol hill station on march 19 2016 via a 18 billion 315mile 507 km tunnel the extension opened six months ahead of its scheduled date and the opening celebrations drew 67000 people during the first day of service sound transit deployed additional threecar light rail trains to cope with higher ridership after the extension opened the line was extended 16 miles 26 km south from seatac airport to angle lake station on september 24 2016 including the opening of a 1120stall park and ridethe escalators at capitol hill and university of washington stations experienced several major failures and shutdowns in the two years since the university link extension was opened these failures were attributed to the installation of standard commercial escalators instead of stronger escalators designed for transit stations a new escalator contractor was selected to provide preventative maintenance in lieu of a proposed replacement plan new stairways and connecting passageways were also opened to allow for alternative access the tukwila section of the line was shut down over one weekend in october 2018 for major repairs after cracks were discovered in the rails on the 1200foot 370 m bridge crossing interstate 5  central link was renamed to the red line as part of a systemwide rebranding in september 2019 by sound transit to prepare for the arrival of east link the blue line two months later the agency announced that it would consider a new name after complaints due to the similarity of the red line with redlining which historically affected residents of the rainier valley a new designation the 1 line colored green was announced in april 2020 and took effect in september 2021in january 2020 sound transit began a tenweek construction project called connect 2020 that required trains to singletrack in the downtown seattle transit tunnel the closure of tracks for work on the east link extension where it meets the existing tracks at international districtchinatown necessitated the construction of a temporary center platform at pioneer square for use by throughriding passengers sound transit deployed fourcar trains running every 1315 minutes and implemented restrictions on carrying bicyclists on trains through downtown the project was completed in late march after a weeklong delay in testing but the frequency restrictions remained due to the coronavirus pandemic and local shutdowns service was reduced to every 30 minutes in april and partially restored in september to every 8 minutes during peak hours and 15 minutes during most other hours the first of the new series 2 light rail vehicles based on the siemens s700 entered service in may 2021the third expansion of the 1 line a 43mile 69 km northern extension from university of washington station to the northgate neighborhood of seattle was funded by the sound transit 2 ballot measure in 2008 and began construction in 2012 the 35mile 56 km tunnel was excavated between july 2014 and september 2016 using two tunnel boring machines creating a pair of bores between the extensions three stations the southernmost section of the extension passes under the university of washington campus and required several mitigation measures to reduce electromagnetic interference for laboratory equipment including rubber dampeners on floating slabs of track and the relocation of sensitive equipment at four facilities the northgate extension opened on october 2 2021 adding three stations to the lines north endservice on the 1 line was disrupted several times in 2022 and 2023 by emergency repairs and maintenance projects that necessitated section closures and singletracking with reduced frequencies the tactile strip on the edge of platforms a several stations in the rainier valley was replaced after premature wear and cracking was discovered on april 27 2023 the ceiling of westlake station was punctured during surface construction and necessitated two weeks of service disruptions in downtown seattle including a forced transfer at pioneer square station a grade crossing at royal brougham way adjacent to stadium station was replaced in august 2023 due to ground settling that had caused it to sink by 3 inches 76 cm the project required trains to singletrack and run with extensive delays which continued during work at othello and rainier beach stations that lasted until midseptember  the northern terminus of the 1 line is northgate station located adjacent to the northgate mall along interstate 5 in north seattle the line heads south along an elevated guideway that dives into the northgate link tunnel in the maple leaf neighborhood the 34mile 55 km tunnel travels southeast through roosevelt serving a station near northeast 65th street and south to u district station before reaching the university of washington campus the tunnel travels southeast under the campus to university of washington station located near

       " ('1st Cavalry Division (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)',\n",
       "  'the 1st cavalry division of the royal yugoslav army was established in 1921 soon after the creation of the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes which became the kingdom of yugoslavia in 1929 in peacetime it consisted of two cavalry brigade headquarters commanding a total of four regiments it was part of the yugoslav 1st army group during the germanled world war ii axis invasion of yugoslavia in april 1941 with a wartime organisation specifying one cavalry brigade headquarters commanding two or three regiments and divisionallevel combat and support units along with the rest of the royal yugoslav army the 1st cavalry division began mobilising on 3 april 1941 following a coup dtat three days later with mobilisation not complete the germans began an air campaign and a series of preliminary operations against the yugoslav frontiers by the end of the following day the divisions cavalry brigade headquarters and all of the divisions cavalry regiments had been detached for duty with other formations of the 1st army group the divisional headquarters and divisionallevel units remained in the vicinity of zagreb until 10 april when they were given orders to establish a defensive line southeast of zagreb along the sava river with infantry and artillery support the division had only begun to deploy for this task when the german 14th panzer division captured zagreb the divisional headquarters and all attached units were then captured by armed croat fifth column groups or surrendered to german troops  the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes was created with the merger of serbia montenegro and the south slavinhabited areas of austriahungary on 1 december 1918 in the immediate aftermath of world war i the army of the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes was established to defend the new state it was formed around the nucleus of the victorious royal serbian army as well as armed formations raised in regions formerly controlled by austriahungary many former austrohungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army from the beginning much like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom the army was dominated by ethnic serbs who saw it as a means by which to secure political hegemony for the large serb minoritythe armys development was hampered by the kingdoms poor economy and this continued during the 1920s in 1929 king alexander changed the name of the country to the kingdom of yugoslavia at which time the army was renamed the royal yugoslav army serbocroatian latin vojska kraljevine jugoslavije vkj the army budget remained tight and as tensions rose across europe during the 1930s it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries consequently at the time world war ii broke out in september 1939 the vkj had several serious weaknesses which included reliance on draught animals for transport and the large size of its formations these characteristics resulted in slow unwieldy formations and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large yugoslav formations had low firepower generals better suited to the trench warfare of world war i were combined with an army that was neither equipped nor trained to resist the fastmoving combined arms approach used by the germans in their invasions of poland and francethe weaknesses of the vkj in strategy structure equipment mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within yugoslavia resulting from two decades of serb hegemony and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government attempts to address the disunity came too late to ensure that the vkj was a cohesive force fifth column activity was also a serious concern not only from the croatian nationalist ustae but also from the countrys slovene and ethnic german minorities    the 1st cavalry division was a horsed cavalry formation established soon after the creation of the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes and was part of the army order of battle formalised in 1921 at which time it consisted of four regiments according to regulations issued by the vkj in 1935 the 1st cavalry division was headquartered in zagreb during peacetime and was under the control of cavalry command in belgrade as was the 2nd cavalry division which was located in southeastern yugoslavia at ni the divisions units were manned by a mixture of fulltime and parttime personnel in peacetime the 1st cavalry division comprised headquarters 1st cavalry brigade in akovec near zagreb headquarters 2nd cavalry brigade in subotica in the banat north of belgrade 2nd cavalry regiment based in virovitica on the drava river in slavonia 3rd cavalry regiment based in subotica 6th cavalry regiment based in zagreb 8th cavalry regiment based in akovec  the wartime organisation of the royal yugoslav army was laid down by regulations issued in 19361937 which introduced a requirement to raise a third cavalry division for war service the strength of a cavalry division was 60007000 men the theoretical war establishment of a fully mobilised yugoslav cavalry division was headquarters and headquarters company a cavalry brigade consisting of 2 or 3 cavalry regiments an artillery battalion of four batteries one of which was motorised and equipped with 47millimetre 19 in antitank guns a bicyclemounted infantry battalion with three rifle companies and one machine gun company a signals squadron a bridging squadron equipped with pontoons a chemical defence platoon a divisional cavalry battalion consisting of two cavalry squadrons a machine gun squadron an engineer squadron and a bicycle company logistics units including a transport battalioneach cavalry regiment was to consist of four cavalry squadrons a machine gun squadron and an engineer squadron shortly before the war an abortive attempt was made to motorise the 1st cavalry division but this was stymied by a lack of motor transport and the division largely remained a horsed formation throughout its existence the 1st cavalry division was also never equipped with the planned motorised antitank battery and the divisional artillery battalion was largely equipped with world war ivintage pieces two peacetime components of the division the headquarters of the 2nd cavalry brigade and the 3rd cavalry regiment were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised so the primary fighting formation of the 1st cavalry division was the 1st cavalry brigade commanding the 2nd 6th and 8th cavalry regiments  in case of war yugoslav planners saw the 1st cavalry division as forming the reserve for the 1st army group the 1st army group was responsible for the defence of northwestern yugoslavia with the subordinate 4th army defending the eastern sector along the hungarian border and the 7th army stationed along the german and italian borders the 1st cavalry division was to be deployed around zagreb on the right of the 4th army was the 2nd army of the 2nd army group the boundary running from just east of slatina through poega towards banja luka and on the left flank of the 7th army the adriatic coast was defended by coastal defence command the yugoslav defence plan saw the 1st army group deployed in a cordon the 4th army behind the drava river between varadin and slatina and the 7th army along the border region from the adriatic in the west to gornja radgona in the east the planners estimated that cavalry formations would take four to seven days to mobilise  after unrelenting pressure from adolf hitler to join the axis powers yugoslavia signed the tripartite pact on 25 march 1941 two days later a military coup dtat overthrew the government that had signed the pact and a new government was formed under the royal yugoslav army air force commander armijski eneral duan simovi a general mobilisation was not called by the new government until 3 april 1941 out of fear of offending hitler and thus precipitating war the same day as the coup hitler had issued fhrer directive 25 which called for yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state on 3 april fhrer directive 26 was issued detailing the plan of attack and the command structure for the invasion which was to commence on 6 aprilaccording to the yugoslav historian velimir terzi on 6 april the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty and the poor provision of animals and vehicles a large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th army detachment ormozkithe commander of the 1st cavalry division was divizijski eneral dragoslav stefanovi while the divisional headquarters and other divisionallevel units were mobilising in sesvete near zagreb the headquarters of the 1st cavalry brigade had been designated to command detachment ormozki and the 6th and 8th cavalry regiments and the divisional artillery battalion had also been allocated to that formation this reduced the main fighting elements of the division to a single cavalry regiment the 2nd which was mobilising in virovitica the rest of the 1st army group reserve comprised an independent artillery battalion mobilising in zagreb and the 110th infantry regiment which was moving to zagreb from celje a distance of 114 km 71 mi to the northwest by early morning of 6 april 1941 when the invasion commenced the 110th regiment had reached zidani most still some 90 km 56 mi from zagreb  stripped of most of its subordinate units the 1st cavalry division remained in reserve near zagreb during the first few days of fighting on 10 april due to the critical situation on the front of the 4th army the division was directed to take under its command the 110th infantry regiment and the independent artillery battalion and defend against crossings of the 110kilometre 68 mi stretch of the river sava between jasenovac and zagreb while collecting stragglers and organising resistance these orders were quickly overtaken by the rapid advance of the 14th panzer division to zagreb when it broke out of its bridgehead across the drava river at zkny on the hungarian border by 1930 on 10 april lead elements of the 14th panzer division had reached the outskirts of zagreb having covered nearly 160 km 99 mi in a single day armed fifth column ustase groups and german troops disarmed the division and its attached units before they could establish any coherent defence along the savaon 15 april orders were received that a ceasefire had been agreed and that all vkj troops were to remain in place and not fire on german personnel after a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document the yugoslav supreme command unconditionally surrendered in belgrade effective at 1200 on 18 april yugoslavia was then occupied and dismembered by the axis germany italy hungary bulgaria and albania all annexed parts of its territory almost all of the croat members of the division taken as prisoners of war were soon released by the germans 90 per cent of those held for the duration of the war were serbs    ')]"
