### Data Collection 

Through API calls, data was collected through the `wikipediaapi` python package. I chose to pull the "Featured Articles" as they consist of the highest quality data curated by wiki editors. I provide a simple python script where you can call the wikipedia API and collect your own data here: [Get wikipedia articles](get_wiki_articles.py)
